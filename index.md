# Hi, I’m Burcu.

I build statistical modeling frameworks for structured, dependent systems—networks, longitudinal processes, survey/census data, and predictive systems where standard independence assumptions break.

I work at the intersection of statistics and data science, currently at the University of New Hampshire.

## Focus

- Modeling under dependence (relational, longitudinal, hierarchical systems)
- Missing data mechanisms & imputation systems
- Network formation / relational inference
- Predictive modeling with calibration, stability & uncertainty
- Statistical computing (R, Python, SAS)

## Selected Work

- **Multi-criteria Evaluation of Health News Stories** (*Decision Support Systems, 2024*)  
  A structured, decision-analytic modeling framework for evaluating health news reliability under uncertainty.

- **Crisis Probability & Policy Intervention Modeling**  
  Panel-based modeling of foreign exchange, inflation, and output crises incorporating structural breaks and heterogeneous treatment effects.

- **Network & Relational Systems Modeling**  
  Statistical models for dynamic and dependent multi-agent systems.
