# Burcu Eke Rubini

I build statistical modeling frameworks for structured, dependent systems like networks, longitudinal processes, survey and census data, and predictive systems where standard independence assumptions break down.

---

## Focus

- **Modeling under dependence:** Relational, longitudinal, and hierarchical systems.
- **Network formation & relational inference:** Structural modeling of interconnected entities.
- **Missing data & imputation systems:** MAR/MNAR mechanisms, large-scale survey and census applications.
- **Predictive modeling:** Calibration, stability, and uncertainty quantification.
- **Statistical computing:** R, Python, and SAS.

## Selected Work

- **Multi-criteria Evaluation of Health News Stories**  
  *Decision Support Systems (2024)*  
  A structured, decision-analytic modeling framework for evaluating health news reliability under uncertainty.

- **Crisis Probability & Policy Intervention Modeling**  
  Panel-based modeling of foreign exchange, inflation, and output crises incorporating structural breaks and heterogeneous treatment effects.

- **Network & Relational Systems Modeling**  
  Statistical models for dynamic and dependent multi-agent systems.

Outside of modeling, I love reading, fiction that is. Just do not ask me my favorite book or author, it is too hard to answer :) In my spare time, you can find me desining experiments to find the perfect recipe for sourdough bread or pizza dough.  </p>
